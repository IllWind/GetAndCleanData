The meanDT data.table was produced by subsetting a much larger data.table, aggregateDT.  meanDT is dimensioned at 180 68; aggregateDT is dimensioned at 10299 563.

The columns (variables) of meanDT are named as follows:

The **subjects** column contains numbers identifying 1 of the 30 subjects who participated in the events that were used to create the data. The **activities** column contains 1 of 6 different activities each subject participated in to generate the data. Each of the remaining 66 columns shows the mean of each activity for each subject for the indicated variable. So, there are 6 records (rows) for each of the 30 subjects, thus the 180 rows.

Each of the variable names reference a group of similarly named variables in the original data.table, aggregateDT. The
meanDT variables are means of two descriptive statistics for each referenced group in the aggregateDT. The aggregateDT
variables are described by the original researchers below in paragraphs 1 through 6.

1. The variables included in this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals Mean.timeAcc.XYZ and Mean.timeGyro.XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (Mean.timeBodyAcc.XYZ and Mean.timeGravityAcc.XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

2. Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccJerk.XYZ and timeBodyGyroJerk.XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccMag, timeGravityAccMag, timeBodyAccJerkMag, timeBodyGyroMag, timeBodyGyroJerkMag). 

3. Finally a Fast Fourier Transform was applied to some of these signals producing freqBodyAcc.XYZ, freqBodyAccJerk.XYZ, freqBodyGyro.XYZ, freqBodyAccJerkMag, freqBodyGyroMag, freqBodyGyroJerkMag. 

4. These signals were subsequently used to estimate variables for each pattern:  
'.XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

    timeBodyAcc.XYZ  
    timeGravityAcc.XYZ  
    timeBodyAccJerk.XYZ  
    timeBodyGyro.XYZ  
    timeBodyGyroJerk.XYZ  
    timeBodyAccMag  
    timeGravityAccMag  
    timeBodyAccJerkMag  
    timeBodyGyroMag  
    timeBodyGyroJerkMag  
    freqBodyAcc.XYZ  
    freqBodyAccJerk.XYZ  
    freqBodyGyro.XYZ  
    freqBodyAccMag  
    freqBodyAccJerkMag  
    freqBodyGyroMag  
    freqBodyGyroJerkMag  

5. The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

    mean: Mean value  
    std: Standard deviation  
    mad: Median absolute deviation   
    max: Largest value in array  
    min: Smallest value in array  
    sma: Signal magnitude area  
    energy: Energy measure, sum of the squares divided by the number of values   
    iqr: Interquartile range  
    entropy: Signal entropy  
    arCoeff: Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4  
    correlation: Correlation coefficient between two signals  
    maxInds: Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude  
    meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency  
    skewness: Skewness of the frequency domain signal   
    kurtosis: Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal   
    bandsEnergy: Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window   
    angle: Angle between to vectors  

6. Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle variable:

    gravityMean  
    timeBodyAccMean  
    timeBodyAccJerkMean  
    timeBodyGyroMean  
    timeBodyGyroJerkMean
